# Statistical-Analysis-of-the-2014-Survey-on-Italian-Household-Finances
##OVERVIEW
This project was made for an academic exam and analyzes data from the 2014 Survey on Italian Household Finances, exploring socioeconomic variables and trying to predict pension status and clusters.
To avoid any possible distorted values a consistent part of the project uses a subset filled only with individuals who really have a pension > 0

###3)Linear Regression Models
-simple regressions for each predictor
-multiple linear regression
- residuals analysis
  
###4)Logistic Regression
-predict pension yes/no
confusion matrix, sensitivity, specificity
ROC curve 

###Cluster Analysis 
Gower distance due to categorical variables
